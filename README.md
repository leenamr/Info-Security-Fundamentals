# Info-Security-Fundamentals: Web Server Security and Attack Simulations

**Project Overview**

This project explores foundational cybersecurity concepts by setting up and securing a web server, simulating Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, and experimenting with password-cracking techniques. It provides practical experience in understanding and mitigating common security threats.

**Features**

Secure Web Server Setup: Build a secure server hosting a basic webpage with SSL encryption.
MITM Attack Simulation: Simulate a controlled MITM attack to capture and manipulate unencrypted data, demonstrating network vulnerabilities.
Password Cracking Exploration: Test SSH dictionary attacks and hash-cracking techniques to understand and address password security risks.

**Project Stages**

1- Web Server Setup: Configure a secure web server with SSL encryption.
2- MITM Simulation: Run MITM simulations to intercept unencrypted traffic and apply filters.
3- Password Cracking: Explore SSH dictionary attacks and hash-cracking techniques.
