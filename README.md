# Info-Security-Fundamentals: Web Server Security and Attack Simulations

## Project Overview 
This project dives into cybersecurity by setting up and securing a personal web server, checking
for weaknesses through a simulated Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, and exploring password
cracking techniques. The first part focuses on creating a safe web server, hosting a basic webpage,
and adding SSL encryption. The second part sets up a controlled environment to mimic a MITM
attack, capturing unencrypted data and applying filters to manipulate it. Finally the third part
examines password cracking methods like SSH dictionary attacks and hash cracking. Through
these tasks, we gain practical knowledge about cybersecurity principles and defense strategies.

## Features
- **Secure Web Server Setup:** Build a secure server hosting a basic webpage with SSL encryption.<br>
- **MITM Attack Simulation:** Simulate a controlled MITM attack to capture and manipulate unencrypted data, demonstrating network vulnerabilities.<br>
- **Password Cracking Exploration:** Test SSH dictionary attacks and hash-cracking techniques to understand and address password security risks.<br>

## Project Stages
1- **Web Server Setup:** Configure a secure web server with SSL encryption.<br>
2- **MITM Simulation:** Run MITM simulations to intercept unencrypted traffic and apply filters.<br>
3- **Password Cracking:** Explore SSH dictionary attacks and hash-cracking techniques.<br>

## Conclusion 
This project thoroughly looked into cybersecurity ideas, starting from making secure
web servers to practicing and shielding against possible attacks. We got practical experience in
setting up servers, securing them with SSL encryption, and finding weak spots through simulated
MITM attacks. We also learned about password cracking methods, emphasizing the need for
strong security tools like firewalls and encryption. By doing these tasks, we are more prepared to
handle real-world cybersecurity issues, making the digital world safer for everyone.
